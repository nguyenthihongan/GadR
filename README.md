What the app should do

An app for you and your friends, for example your classmates at the University. With the app, you can open your mobile phone and see where your friends are in a map view. From there you can follow your friendâ€™s status updates and social events they arrange. You can update your status (what you are doing) and if you are hosting an event like a football game on TV, Studies before your math exam in a specific group activity room or maybe a pre party before Akademin. Your friends can then easy notice and get a good view on what is going on and spontaneously choose to take part of the activity. By taking part of an event, you get event points, and by hosting an event you get higher experience points and a higher status for your next hosted events.

A good example for using the app would be during the kick off. In this scenario the Fadder(The older student responsible for the new students) can create a group in GadR, which he then invites the students in the class to. In this way the class will be connected instantly. During the kick-off, it would be a nice to see where your classmates are, in case you oversleep or you lack the information where the class is hanging out. In GadR the members can choose to share their GPS-position live on a map, this way the student can easily see where all the fun is.
In this group, anyone can create an event and pin it on the map. Someone might suggest pre drinks at his place before heading out to the club, he will then place a pin on the map with the address and description of the event. The rest of the group will get a notification about the event and and choose to attend it. 
When the kick off is over, the app will still be used to create events, such as movie nights or drinks. This way, you can more spontaneously hang out with classmates that you normally do not hang out with.
